/*Kernel Prelude

    * This header file is included in every kernel source file.
    * It contains essential definitions and includes that are needed
    * throughout the kernel codebase.
    *
    * It is important to keep this file minimal to avoid unnecessary dependencies
    * and to ensure that it can be included in any kernel source file without
    * causing circular dependencies or other issues.
